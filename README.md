# Pig-Game
This is a game for 2 players. The goal of the game is to reach 100 points faster than your opponent. This project was developed as an exercise in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

Instruction:
1. Download the files in the repository and put them in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in your preferred browser.

Functionality:

As players take turns, both players use the same buttons to take actions. The active player is highlighted. At any point you can open the Rules. It doesn't reset the progress you made in the game. You can also reset the game at any point.

The Rules button is an extra feature I created myself - it wasn't in the task. It could've resulted in an awkward HTML/CSS. At the moment of writing I'm just learning JavaScript though, so that's okay.
